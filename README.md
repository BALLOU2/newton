Newton, Massachusetts Open GIS Data on GitHub

The City of Newton is in the process of posting its major GIS data to this site. 

These layers will also be available for download in Shapefile format on our website at http://www.newtonma.gov/gov/it/gis/gis.asp

Our data is in Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System NAD 83, feet, except those files converted to GeoJSON which are in WGS84. Data is frequently updated. If you have any questions, comments or further data requests, please email us at gisinfo@newtonma.gov

GitHub recognizes our GeoJSON files and creates interactive maps using Mapbox for most files. You can also view or download the raw GeoJSON using the 'Raw' button.
